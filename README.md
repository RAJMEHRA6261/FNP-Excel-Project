Executive Summary – FNP Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI to help FNP (Ferns N Petals) evaluate its nationwide sales performance across multiple business dimensions. The dashboard delivers a unified view of revenue patterns, customer spending behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency, enabling data-driven decisions for marketing, inventory planning, and strategic growth.

The dashboard aggregates and visualizes data such as orders, revenue, delivery timelines, and customer demographics, empowering stakeholders to quickly identify performance gaps, seasonal trends, and high-value opportunities. The analysis supports business functions including category management, regional sales optimization, and customer engagement strategies.

Key performance indicators such as Total Orders (1000), Total Revenue (₹35,20,984), Average Delivery Time (5.53 days), and Average Customer Spend (₹3,520.98) provide a concise overview of business health. The report incorporates interactive slicers for Order Date, Delivery Date, and Occasion, enabling dynamic filtering and granular insights.

A multidimensional sales breakdown shows that occasions like Anniversary, All Occasions, and Raksha Bandhan generate the highest revenue. Product categories such as Colors, Soft Toys, and Sweets emerge as strong revenue contributors. The analysis further highlights top-performing cities including Dhanbad, Imphal, and Kavali, indicating regional sales strength. Time-based charts illustrate peak order hours (mainly evenings) and seasonal revenue spikes during February, March, August, and September, correlating with major festivals and gifting trends.

The dashboard also emphasizes product performance; top revenue-generating items include Magmam Set, Dolores Gift, and Harum Pack, offering insights for product placement and promotion. Month-wise and hour-wise revenue patterns help predict demand, optimize delivery capacity, and plan marketing campaigns.

Overall, this dashboard serves as a strategic tool enabling FNP to monitor KPIs, understand customer behavior, optimize product offerings, and enhance operational efficiency. It supports faster decision-making, improved sales planning, and greater customer satisfaction, making it an essential asset for data-driven business management.
